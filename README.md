# Energy-Efficient-Smart-Home-Lightning-System
This project focuses on an Energy-Efficient Smart Home Lighting System that adapts to ambient light and motion. Using Arduino Uno, LDR and PIR sensors, it adjusts lights dynamically for energy savings. A mobile app enables auto and manual control, achieving accurate light detection, dynamic control, and reduced power usage for smart homes.
